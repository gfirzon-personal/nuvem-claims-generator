To generate a `Pipfile` from requirements.txt, you can use the `pipenv` tool. Here are the steps:

1. Install `pipenv` if you haven't already:
    ```sh
    pip install pipenv
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing your requirements.txt file:
    ```sh
    cd /C:/development/Nuvem/Nuvem Dedup system/nuvem-claims-generator
    ```

3. Run the following command to create a `Pipfile` from requirements.txt:
    ```sh
    pipenv install -r requirements.txt
    ```

This will create a `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` in your project directory with the dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
